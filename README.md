## Technologies
I used `ReactJS`, `HTML`, `CSS`

## Setup
- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`

## Approach
I created the desktop first app with responsive design for Tablet and Mobile devices. I used `Weather API` for getting weather data.

## Status
Weather APP is completed. `Version 2` will be out soon where I'll use `React Context API` for state management.
